# jetzt

*jetzt* is a speed-reader extension for [chrome](http://google.com/chrome) inspired by [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/).

### Installation

This is very much beta software so a proper chrome extension package is not currently provided. Instead: clone this repository, then, in chrome, navigate to chrome://extensions , enable developer mode, click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the directoy you cloned.

Remember to pull every now and then for bugfixes and new features.

You can also use our bookmarklet by manually adding a new bookdrag and pasting the content of bookmarklet.js in the location field. 

### Usage

Control is currently keyboard-only.

- Initiate jetzt by selecting some text and pressing `alt`-`s`.

- Change size with `+`/`-`.

- Go faster/slower with up/down arrow keys.

- Go back/forward a sentence with left/right arrow keys (hold `alt` to navigate by paragraphs).

- Pause with space.

- Close with escape.
